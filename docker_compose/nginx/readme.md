# Nginx Docker Compose

The docker file will set up an nginx-proxy-manager instance.

Once installed, the reverse proxy can be managed via the web gui on port 81.

After the tunnel is confirmed to be working, you still need to configure the IP, port, hostname, etc. in the cloudflare zero trust dashboard.
