# Future Plans

## Kubernetes

I plan to sometime soon :tm: migrate to Kubernetes for hosting my services. I'd like to move as much over as I can minus a few essential services such as VPN and a Windows VM or two.

I'm not sure what distribution I want to use. I'm contemplating between stock K8s, K3s, OKD (OpenShift), and Talos.
