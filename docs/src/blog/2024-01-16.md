# 2024-01-16 Minecraft Server Rabbit Hole

## Overview 

My big project lately has been running a minecraft server on Docker (itzg/minecraft-server docker image), and to be honest I have just as much fun administrating it as playing. The docker compose file is [here](https://github.com/spicyFajitas/cookbooks/blob/master/ansible/roles/minecraft/templates/docker-compose.yml.j2) - it's in the corresponding ansible role.

Looking through that is a bit of a rabbit hole - the TLDR is that I set up the minecraft server and set up dynamic DNS with cloudflare, then wanted to run backups (itzg/mc-backup docker image sidecar service), then wanted to get discord notifications for logins and logouts (*security* lol), and then the backups started filling the disk so I set up Netdata for monitoring things, and it's spiraling into another project where I configure Netdata monitoring and alerting on my major hosts.

For the discord notifications, I forked and created [my own container](https://github.com/spicyFajitas/minecraft-discord-webhook) because the notifications from the [parent project](https://github.com/saadbruno/minecraft-discord-webhook) would only be embedded messages, which weren't showing text previews on my phone, so I'd have to manually open Discord every time I wanted to check instead of being able to read the notification. I had to learn building container images and pushing them to the GitHub Container Repository, so this has really spiraled into many offshoot projects.
