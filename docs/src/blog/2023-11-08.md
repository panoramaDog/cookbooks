# 2023-11-08 State of the Homelab (working document)

## Overview

> About my homelab

My homelab started back in 2019 when a coworker at my community college let me borrow a raspberry pi to implement PiHole at home. I was able to "script kiddie" my way through the installation guide, and it worked quite nicely at home. My parents even noticed the lack of ads and really liked it!

For now, I'll list some of the major steps that were pivotal in my development of my homelab.

List:

    - installing Linux flavors on old desktop from a local computer repair company
    - hosting minecraft server from local Windows desktop
    - received some Lenovo ThinkCentre computers from place I interned at summer of 2021. Major step because I finally have my own hardware
    - convert desktop to UnRaid system
    - build TrueNAS server
    - learned Docker (compose)
    - learn Proxmox better (host on Lenovo ThinkCentre's and OptiPlex) (configuration, backups, pruning backups, storage types, other stuff in my [Proxmox Docs](../homelab/proxmox.md))
    - start internship in Mad, WI
    - learn ansible
    - learn to read logs better (*woooooowwww*)
    - become familiar with Linux more (Ubuntu/Debian specifically)
    - (mostly) fully automate deployment of Docker host VM with Packer for VM templating, Terraform for VM deployment, and ansible for configuration deployment
    - trying to learn Kubernetes, really burnt out on Kubernetes
    - minecraft server led me to implement Netdata
